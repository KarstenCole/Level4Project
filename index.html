            This version of Tic Tac Toe plays mechanically like regular Tic Tac Toe. One player is X and the other is O.
            Turn by turn, each player puts his or her letter into one of the squares on the 3X3 grid. If there are 3 in a
            row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) that player is the winner.
        </p>
       <p id="p2">
            Two Layer Tic Tac Toe differs in that players can take spaces away from one another. A space can only
            be locked if you take it twice. For example, if you put your X on the center square, the other player can
            place his or her O on the center square later and take it away from you. If you place a second X on the
            center square before your opponent takes it away, youâ€™ve claimed it for good.
        </p>
        <p id="p3">
            If there is a letter on the space, whether once or twice, the space is considered held by that player.
            A player may not move on the same space his or her opponent took on the previous turn. For example,
            if I take the center square, you cannot move onto the center square on your very next turn. You can
            only do it on a later turn.
